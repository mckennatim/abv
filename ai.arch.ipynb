    "# htmx\n",
    "htmx is a JavaScript library that lets you make parts of your HTML page update dynamically by sending HTTP requests to the server and replacing parts of the DOM with the server’s response—without reloading the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How htmx works:**\n",
    "- You add attributes like `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-swap`, etc. to HTML elements.\n",
    "- When a user interacts (click, submit, etc.), htmx sends an AJAX request to the server.\n",
    "- The server returns HTML (not JSON).\n",
    "- htmx swaps the targeted part of the page with the returned HTML (using `hx-target` and `hx-swap`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does the whole page update?**\n",
    "- No. Only the targeted element(s) are updated. The rest of the page stays as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the browser update?**\n",
    "- The browser updates only the DOM element(s) specified by `hx-target` with the HTML returned by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does the server push the update?**\n",
    "- By default, no. htmx is client-initiated: the browser requests, the server responds.\n",
    "- For server push, htmx supports [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://htmx.org/docs/#sse) and [WebSockets](https://htmx.org/extensions/web-sockets/), allowing the server to push updates to the client, but this requires extra setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "htmx enables partial page updates by swapping in server-rendered HTML, triggered by client-side events. The server does not push updates unless you use SSE or WebSockets.\n",
    "\n"

    "Yes. In htmx, if a user action on one page causes a change in the server-side data or content, that change will be reflected the next time the user navigates to another page that displays that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- htmx updates only the current page’s DOM in response to user actions.\n",
    "- If the action changes something on the server (e.g., updates a database, edits a file), any page that loads that data will show the updated content the next time it is loaded or refreshed.\n",
    "- htmx does not automatically update other open pages or tabs; the update is seen when the user navigates or reloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "The update is visible on other pages when they are next loaded or refreshed, because the server now returns the new data. htmx does not sync changes across open pages in real time unless you use server push (SSE/WebSockets)."

    "htmx works seamlessly with Flask by letting Flask routes return HTML fragments in response to AJAX requests triggered by htmx attributes in your HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. In your HTML, add htmx attributes (e.g., `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-target`) to elements.\n",
    "2. When a user interacts (click, submit, etc.), htmx sends an AJAX request to a Flask route.\n",
    "3. The Flask route processes the request and returns an HTML snippet (not a full page).\n",

    "- **Disadvantage:** Needs htmx library, server must return HTML fragments.\n",
