## Discussions with Margery

Yes, I can do that. My biggest challenge is paying attention to my emails. 

Regarding changes, I think the only structural change was to add a new file: calendar.html. The index.html now just has chorus info stuff in it. I am thinking your system with the html editor will still work on calendar.html.

I would love it if we could continue to work together. The changes beneath the basic structure make the pages responsive, easier to read on the phone. The html is all cleaned up. Styles are pulled out into styles.css. The calendar remains a table, again with styles separate from the html tags. 

These changes will allow us to make the updating process much easier, quicker and cleaner allowing us to transition at whatever pace we are each comfortable with. I have already written some code that I use when I update. It is in its initial stages but I am using that code already to make my updates and to do things like automatically convert .docx to pdf, and clean up the file names so they can be more easily viewed and processed.

Perhaps sometime this late fall or winter we could meet and talk over our collaboration

Guess I was looking in the wrong folder for the reorganized files. Thanks for fixing the notes link. I can see that you are refining the layout (double-spaces have returned to the "complete" page, for example).

I am not sure that collaboration will work, especially since I sense you want the freedom to reorganize and use tools you are developing. For example, I had originally chosen to put the schedule on the main page, because it is the most important information; now members have to dig down underneath for it. Not a big deal; I don't hate the new structure and do not mind if you keep it, but you did make that change without collaboration. Also, whatever methods you implement, it's important that the site can continue to be maintained by someone without your tools.

- It is important to make changes fairly quickly.  I found if I did not do so, I would fall behind and get confused; maybe you can keep track better than I! Chorus members also get upset if they cannot find music and schedule updates. (Sadly, I think some of them do not know how to search their email.) Talking about updates: could you add that translation file for Lo Yare?

- The MONTHLY CALENDAR and WEEKLY CALENDAR headings do not render that well; they stack up on my phone or on my computer if I reduce window size. (Maybe you don't need them?)

- To tidy things up, I deleted the unused folder rehearsal_notes_2025_2026.

- I assumed that you were done making changes for today, so as a test I edited the calendar file and corrected errors in the schedule. I needed to go edit the source to make some changes because I was unable to make the edits in the WYSIWYG editor, possibly because of the new detailed HTML date classes?

The columns stack as part of responsive design, the columns stack for small screen sizes. Instead of seeing all the columns and tiny text.when viewing on the phone they stack, since scrolling down on phones is easy and the text and links are easier to view/tap.

As for tools to make editing easier, they can also (eventually be hosted on the site as an admin page.

Sometimes I am directed to update the site with new info such as a schedule change, and ALSO to announce it to the chorus. I prefer that the person with the info simply send it to the chorus themselves, and trust that I would know to quickly update the website upon reading. Someone was telling members not to use the main email list under any circumstances--that it was only for Derek, chorus committee members; I made a point of disagreeing but the belief is still out there. Maybe that's why Laura did not send it herself. Sometimes it has been easier for me to just do the announcing than push back. You got the December 14 change on the website correctly, however I made a mistake in my announcement--social time is before rehearsal time--and now have to send a correction!

Clarifying your comment
   Yes, I can do that. My biggest challenge is paying attention to my emails. 

So just making completely sure--you are willing to be the main person for the website? I would be in favor, because after creating it 14-15 years ago and maintaining it (as you can see, I use that term loosely!) I am seriously burnt out. In addition to the website, I have been doing the email list maintenance; although that's only a big chore early in the season. Repeating a few of my related thoughts:

- The community expects updates to be made promptly. We could reduce those expectations, but I think it's a good practice. As I mentioned, many members don't seem to know how to search their email. And they certainly don't know that all emails are stored at https://groups.google.com/ .
- I am on all the email lists, so I see audio files etc. that are sent to the individual sections rather than the main list. I can forward those to you, or put you on the section lists as well. Or something else we haven't thought of!
- I look forward to learning your methods so I can be an effective backup. Every few years, I would search for a way to clean up the increasingly horrendous source code, but never got very far.

Margery,
Sure I am happy to be the main person and would appreciate it if you were the backup.

As I worked on the site, and even before, I was continually impressed by what a cool resource it has been for ABV for all these years. You have done an amazing job of creating a consistently clear and useful web presentation that has worked well for everybody. You have created a website that is a core and important part of ABV.

 I am going to have to up my email game and improve my politeness moving forward, but I am guessing that will be good for me. 

My secret agenda is to give you a well deserved break, while I, on and off, work on the editing tools. At the point when they are presentable and debugged, I intend to lure you back in as co-admin:)

BTW
Who administers abvchorus.org's domain and host? Who do you talk to if you need approval to do something?

Hi, Sandy and Tim. Tim and I will be discussing the direction of the chorus website. I would wait on any effort to move abvchorus.org to a faster host.

Tim, probably we should talk more, maybe in person or a virtual video discussion. I am unclear on your ideas for maintaining the site. Whatever we do, a primary goal is to keep it maintainable by a person without extensive technical skills, and I wonder if we are moving away from that.

I'm fine with the type of changes Tim is suggesting. We will need to coordinate for passwords and admin ownership; possibly needing to be online together to register everyone. 
Once the 2 of you are confident about what changes you want, let me know and we'll work on it. 
thanks,
Sandy

Margery,

Sure, I prefer to meet in person. I agree there are things we should discuss. I am out of town Wednesday till Sunday early. So perhaps after the concert would be best. 

To be clear, it is not just about a faster host, but a better host that would give ABV the access needed to maintain the site and make upgrades less onerous. A person with technical skills (me, if we can come to some agreement on this), would be a person who creates tools to allow a person without technical skills to easily update the site. You can't do that on the very limited hosting environment the site is currently in. 

Once those tools are created and hosted on a new server, no technical skills would be needed to use them. The site that ABV members will see will still be just static HTML pages with links, just like it is today. You would not even need to use the new tools, you could use winSCP and KompoZer, but frankly I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

I do have some proposals, in the short term, that I would like you to consider. 

1. Modify where resources are stored for songs ( for new additions to our repertoire). It makes better sense from a data processing point of view, not to have files for a song stored in more than one subdirectory. The file extension tells us what kind of file it is.
     *  all section leader audio, other audio, other video, sheet music and translations will go in the same song subfolder we could call it 'songs' or 'lids'. The subdirectory would be derived from the song name as you have been doing but without spaces and non alphanumeric characters. ex: for 'A new song's name' would be stored in 
        *  'resources/lids/a_new_songs_name/bass_listen_and_repeat.mp3' 
        *  'resources/lids/a_new_songs_name/sheet_music.pdf'
     * existing files would not need to move, their links would still work
     * How ABV users see the song entry in 'music-complet.html' would remain the same, grouped under 'Audio' or whatever.
     * it will always be obvious where the files are stored, the links in the page will tell you.
     * all links in calendar can remain in `resources/other/rehearsal_notes/25-26/xxx

Here is a draft agenda for our meeting:

* discuss your concerns about our collaboration
* discuss my concerns about our collaboration
* consider my proposal for file storage locations
* discuss the idea of eventually moving to a new server
* discuss your concerns about what adding admin tools would mean for a future without a tech-skilled admin.
* go over the process of using KompoZer to edit the HTML-5 version of the code for calendar.html and music-complete.html. (we will need our computers to do this)

I hope that we can come to an agreement that allows for both short-term continuation of my involvement and long term joint improvement to the site.
  
All the best,<br>
Tim
