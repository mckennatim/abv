Hi Margery,

I did some work on the new server and the chorus website is replicated and running there: [http://107.172.72.246](http://107.172.72.246)

If you could check and see if you can connect there with winscp that would be great. 

    host: 107.172.72.246
    username: abv
    password: abeserevelt10

See if your editing tools will work. We will need them as site editing option for you until such time as https://abvchorus.org/admin page is live and you decide to edit that way. 


I will be in touch with Sandy to get us access to the domain registrar. If everything is working on your end, I will make the move to redirect abvchorus.org to 107.172.72.246. 

We will still have access to the old server for as long as we want to archive whatever else is there onto the new site.

I would like to do this rather expeditiously. Derek is already rolling out the new repetoire and keeping the the existing updated AND the new site updated durung the transfer will be a bit tedious.

To that end I ask that from today until the transfer is done, we keep a shared list of what we have changed on the existing site so we don't lose those changes during the transfer.

Thakns for your tolerance and willing to go through these changes. Things will be better and administering the site will be easier down the road.
